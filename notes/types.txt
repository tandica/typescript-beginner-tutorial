The types include:

any
- a variable that can describe any type of value
- declaring a variable without initializing it
- Ex: let snow;
- best practices: avoid using this type because the value can be redeclared which defeats the whole purpose of typescript

unknown

never

enum

tuple
- a fixed length array where each element has a particular type
- used when working with a pair of values, like a user with an ID and a name
- useful mostly when working with 2 values
- if you add more values, there will be an error because it targets only 2 elements (example below)
- Ex: let user: [number, string] = [1, "Tandi"]
